              <p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Company does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as &ldquo; Forks &rdquo;), and that such Forks may materially affect the Services.

              <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Underlying networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). Company does not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to funds on the Tezos blockchain or other network. Neither Company nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect your funds. Once your private key(s) is lost, you will not be able to transfer your Digital Assets to any other address or wallet. If this occurs, you will not be able to realize any value or utility that you may hold now or in future.</span></p>
              <h3 class="c1" id="h.lpyt88rpmudc"><span class="c2">4.4 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</span></h3>

              <p class="c0"><span class="c4">You acknowledge and understand that Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies, Digital Assets and Services, which could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets or property. </span><span class="c4">To the extent possible, it is intended to update the protocol underlying the Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;By using the Services or accessing the Site, you acknowledge these inherent risks.</span></p>

              <p class="c0"><span class="c4">You understand that Tezos and other blockchain technologies and associated Digital Assets, currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Tezos blockchain.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">You acknowledge these risks and represent that </span><span class="c3">Company cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.</span></p>

              <h3 class="c1" id="h.dknuwsqeyqj2"><span class="c2">11.1 Initial Dispute Resolution</span></h3>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes with the Company and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from the Company.</span></p>
              <h3 class="c1" id="h.ca2e2y7t0rs7"><span class="c2">11.2 Binding Arbitration</span></h3>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Company: (a) waive your right to have any and all disputes or claims arising from this Agreement or the Company (collectively, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) resolved in a court; and (b) waive your right to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it, instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</span></p>
              <h3 class="c1" id="h.ix98yt16sa82"><span class="c2">11.3. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</span></h3>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3">You and the Company agree that any dispute is personal to you and the Company and that any such dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and the Company agree that a dispute cannot be brought as a class, or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</span></p>
              <h3 class="c1" id="h.9yclu2i8ogja"><span class="c2">11.4 Process</span></h3>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c4">You and the Company agree that you will notify each other in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the Company shall be provided by sending an email to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;legal@hover.engineering</span><span class="c4">. Your notice must include: (1) your name, postal address, and email address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the Company receiving the notice, either you or Company may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 11, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in court. You and the Company agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and the Company agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute). </span><span class="c4">You and the Company agree that: (a) any arbitration will occur in New York County, New York; (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (c) the state or federal courts in New York will have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award and over any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration. You may also litigate a Dispute in small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</span></p>
              <h3 class="c1" id="h.eho7a9csd9sc"><span class="c2">11.5. Authority of Arbitrator</span></h3>

The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&rsquo; s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</span></p>

By agreeing to be bound by this Agreement, you either: (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS; or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</span></p>
              <h3 class="c1" id="h.5ayqhvt86axi"><span class="c2">11.7 Governing law</span></h3>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c4">For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Company agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, New York. </span><span class="c3">You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available. The Agreement and the relationship between you and Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.</span></p>
