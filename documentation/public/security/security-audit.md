# Security Audit

## Status
The Kolibri project has been audited by <a href="https://leastauthority.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Least Authority</a>, and no contract code updates have taken place since the review was conducted. There were no major findings discovered that would put funds or the economic model at risk, but as with every security review it's only an indicator of security, not a guarantee.
